                        Vermeer lived at the period, also called the silver period, when silver had become available in large amounts. All around the world, business transactions were made in silver. Although the possible usage of silver was restricted to decorative purposes, silver had become the general method of riches. Principle providers of Silver were Japan and latin america. The Chinese amassed large quantities of silver since they were not involved in getting transactions with European commodities but had silver payments for the porcelain, textile wear and other strange commodities they produced and had become the rage in Europe. Moreover, in Taiwan, one portion of gold would be purchased for six units of silver instead of those twelve in Europe.
